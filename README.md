# SkyeTools

### A collection of useful tools made by myself.

* [SkyeDownloader](https://tools.skye.codes/downloader) - Download media from Twitter, Youtube, Reddit and many other
  websites.
* [SkyeConverter](https://tools.skye.codes/converter) - Convert between different media file formats.
* [SkyeTV](https://tools.skye.codes/tv) - Watch movies and shows online (not made by me, only self-hosting).

This website is powered by Angular v16 (front-end) and Spring Boot v3 (back-end). Its home page is accessible
